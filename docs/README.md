# Norch Crawlers

A NodeJS crawler library to quick and easy build versatile crawlers. Just to make working with `request` and `cheerio` a little easier and to not have to write all the standard stuff over and over again.

If somebody is crawling your site and this URL pops up, they haven't remembered to set up their own page stating their purpouse with the crawler.
