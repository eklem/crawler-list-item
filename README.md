# crawler-list-item
Two crawlers crawling lists for URLs and URLs for items.

Based on `request`, `cheerio` and `jsonfile`.

Should explain:
* [ ] List page
* [ ] Item page

... and show how to:
* [ ] List
  * [ ] Grab URLs from a (list) page
  * [ ] Traverse
  * [ ] Check for last page to traverse
  * [ ] Check for updates (store last in temp.json)
* [ ] Item
  * [ ] Get title + text
  * [ ] Grab a list on the page and push to array
  * [ ] JSON stream
* [ ] When `request` doesn't do it: Crawl using [phantom.js](Check out phantom.js. The data seems a bit hard to get with just `request`)
